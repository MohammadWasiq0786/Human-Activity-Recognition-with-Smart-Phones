Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is classifying activity of a person using responsive sensors that are affected from human movement. Both users and capabilities (sensors) of smartphones increase and users usually carry their smartphone with them.

Activity recognition is used in many applications such as surveillance, medical equipments, anti-terrorists, and anti-crime securities as well as life logging and assistance. Environment-based sensors are used to detect the users' interaction with the environment and interaction with objects that are also equipped with sensors.

**Object:**

The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.
